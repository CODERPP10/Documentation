# chatHistory

`chatHistory` is a new addition to the Mineflayer.py package that allows you to search for a specific chat history from players and servers.



```python filename="bot.py" {3} copy
# if no `server` is specified the current server will be used
bot.chatHistory(username="mineflayer", server="2b2t.org")
```
