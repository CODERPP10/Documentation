# Introduction
 
Welcome to Mineflayer.py!

## What is Mineflayer.py?

Mineflayer.py is a flexible, powerful, and easy to use python library built on top of the Mineflayer JavaScript package. It allows you to create Minecraft bots that can perform various tasks such as farming, mining, as well as basic to complex realistic player interactions.

## Why not use the official python way?

Mineflayer.py offers more build in features, documentation, plugins and support. On top of all that Mineflayer.py also allows you to use a nice React based web app.
