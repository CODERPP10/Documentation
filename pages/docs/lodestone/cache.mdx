# Cache Issues


### Online IDE Cache
When running an application on an Online IDE (eg: [repl.it](https://replit.com/)) you may run into an issue where you are repeatedly asked to validate your Microsoft account. You'll need to override the setting `profilesFolder` so the cache is stored in a local folder.


```python copy
bot = lodestone.createBot(
  profilesFolder='./nmp-cache' # Create a cache folder in the current directory
)
```
