# Ignoring Block Entities

If you start receiving a message in console such as;

```
Ignoring block entities as chunk failed to load at 6 -6
Ignoring block entities as chunk failed to load at 6 -5
Ignoring block entities as chunk failed to load at 6 -4
Ignoring block entities as chunk failed to load at 6 -3
Ignoring block entities as chunk failed to load at 6 -2
Ignoring block entities as chunk failed to load at 6 1
Ignoring block entities as chunk failed to load at 6 2
Ignoring block entities as chunk failed to load at 6 3
Ignoring block entities as chunk failed to load at 6 4
```

Then you may have specified a bad `version` in `createBot` and the bot is unable to process the chunks, or the server is sending bad packets to the client.

If you want to ignore this issue you can set `logErrors: false` (recommended) or `hideErrors: true`
