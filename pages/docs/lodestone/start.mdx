# Lodestone: Getting Started

Lodestone Docs Theme is a theme that includes almost everything you need to build a
modern documentation website. It includes a top navigation bar, a search bar, a
pages sidebar, a TOC sidebar, and other built-in components.

This website itself is built with the Lodestone Docs Theme.

## Deploy to Replit

You can start by creating your own Lodestone site and deploying to Vercel by
clicking the link:

<a
  className="mt-3 inline-flex"
  target="_blank"
  href="https://vercel.com/new/clone?s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshuding%2FLodestone-docs-template&showOptionalTeamCreation=false"
>
  ![](https://vercel.com/button)
</a>

Vercel will fork the
[Lodestone Docs template](https://github.com/shuding/Lodestone-docs-template) and
deploy the site for you. Once done, every commit in the repository will be
deployed automatically.


## Start a New Project

<Steps>
### Install

To create a Lodestone Docs site manually, you have to install **Next.js**,
**React**, **Lodestone**, and **Lodestone Docs Theme**. In your project directory, run
the following command to install the dependencies:

```sh copy
pip install lodestone
```

<Callout>
  If you already have Next.js installed in your project, you only need to
  install `Lodestone` and `Lodestone-theme-docs` as the add-ons.
</Callout>

### Create a bot.py

Create the following `bot.py` file in your projectâ€™s root directory:

```python filename="bot.py"
# import the package
import mineflayer
 
# create the bot
bot = mineflayer.createBot(
  host='localhost',          # minecraft server ip
  username='Bot',            # username or email, switch if you want to change accounts
  auth='microsoft'           # for offline mode servers, you can set this to 'offline'
  # port=25565,              # only set if you need a port that isn't 25565
  # version='false',         # only set if you need a specific version or snapshot (ie: "1.8.9" or "1.16.5"), otherwise it's set automatically
  # password='12345678'      # set if you want to use password-based auth (may be unreliable). If specified, the `username` must be an email
)
 
# do not run code here that needs acces to the bot!
 
# start the bot
bot.start()
 
# run code on the bot here!
```

With the above configuration, Lodestone can handle Markdown files in your Next.js
project, with the specified theme. Other Lodestone configurations can be found in
[Guide](/docs/guide).

### Sign in

Lastly, create the corresponding `theme.config.jsx` file in your projectâ€™s root
directory. This will be used to configure the Lodestone Docs theme:

```jsx filename="theme.config.jsx"
export default {
  logo: <span>My Lodestone Documentation</span>,
  project: {
    link: 'https://github.com/shuding/Lodestone'
  }
  // ... other theme options
}
```

Full theme configurations can be found
[here](/docs/docs-theme/theme-configuration).

### Ready to Go!

Now, you can create your first MDX page as `pages/index.mdx`:

```mdx filename="pages/index.mdx"
# Welcome to Lodestone

Hello, world!
```

And run the `next` or `next dev` command specified in `package.json`to start
developing the project! ðŸŽ‰
