**Let's get started!**


{/* ## Deploy to Replit

You can start by creating your own Lodestone site and deploying to Vercel by
clicking the link:

<a
  className="mt-3 inline-flex"
  target="_blank"
  href="https://vercel.com/new/clone?s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshuding%2FLodestone-docs-template&showOptionalTeamCreation=false"
>
  ![](https://vercel.com/button)
</a>

Vercel will fork the
[Lodestone Docs template](https://github.com/shuding/Lodestone-docs-template) and
deploy the site for you. Once done, every commit in the repository will be
deployed automatically. */}


## Start a New Project

<Steps>
### Install

To start **building** a **Lodestone** based bot, you first have to install the **lodestone**,
package. 
run the following command to install the package:

```pip copy
pip install lodestone
```

<Callout>
  If you already have the lodestone package installed you can skip this step, you only need to
  install `lodestone` for the bot to work.
</Callout>

### Create a bot.py

Create the following `bot.py` file in your projectâ€™s root directory:

```python filename="bot.py"
import lodestone

bot = lodestone.createBot(
  host='localhost',
  username='Bot',
)
```

With the above configuration, Lodestone will create a bot with the name `bot` that joins the java server `localhost` (localy run server). Other Lodestone bot creation configurations can be found
[Here](/docs/lodestone/bot-configuration).


### Run your bot

After coding your very own Minecraft bot you can simply run the following command to start the bot!:

```bash filename="Terminal"
# can be python3 on some systems
python bot.py
```

And run the `next` or `next dev` command specified in `package.json`to start
developing the project! ðŸŽ‰


### Sign in

Lastly, if your not already signed in bot will ask you to sign in using Microsoft by default. The message will look something like this:

```
It seems you are not logged in, please go to https://microsoft.com/link and enter the following code: ********
```

after you sucsessfully sign in in to your account account the bot will be created.

Full auth configurations can be found
[here](/).
