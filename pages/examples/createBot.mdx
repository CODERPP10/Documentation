# MinecraftBot

At the core of creating a bot using mineflayer.py is the function `createBot()`, this is where you'll want to declare the variable used for the bot, as well as setting the options for your bot such as the target server's ip (`host`), port (`port`), version (`version`), the type of authentication (`auth`), and your username (`username`). There are other options you can use, but for the basics this is all you'll need for this guide.



```python filename="bot.py" {3} copy
# import the package
# import the package
import mineflayer
 

bot = mineflayer.createBot(
  host='localhost',          # minecraft server ip
  username='Bot',            # username or email, switch if you want to change accounts
  auth='microsoft'           # for offline mode servers, you can set this to 'offline'
  # port: 25565,             # only set if you need a port that isn't 25565
  # version: false,          # only set if you need a specific version or snapshot (ie: "1.8.9" or "1.16.5"), otherwise it's set automatically
  # password: '12345678'     # set if you want to use password-based auth (may be unreliable). If specified, the `username` must be an email
)

# do not run code here that needs acces to the bot!

# start the bot
bot.start()

# run code on the bot here!
