# MinecraftBot

At the core of creating a bot using mineflayer.py is the function `MinecraftBot()`, this is where you'll want to declare the variable used for the bot, as well as setting the options for your bot such as the target server's ip (`host`), port (`port`), version (`version`), the type of authentication (`authentication`), and your username (`username`). There are other options you can use, but for the basics this is all you'll need for this guide.



```python filename="bot.py" {3} copy
# import the package
from opendeliverybot.bot import MinecraftBot

# set main settings
config = {
    "server_ip": "example.net",
    "server_port": "25565",
    "bot_name": "example@gmail.com",
    "password": "",
    "auth": "microsoft",
    "version": "1.19",
    "check_timeout_interval": 20,
    "armor_manager": True,
    "viewer_ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "viewer_port": "5001",
    "quit_on_low_health": False,
    "low_health_threshold": 10
}

# create the bot
bot = MinecraftBot(config=config)

# do not run code here that needs acces to the bot!

# start the bot
bot.start()

# run code on the bot here!
```
